This is a ripped off version of
PATCHWORK: A Multiphysics/Multiscale/Multiframe General Relativistic Hydrodynamic Simulation Code
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170105610S
A copy of the paper is included in this directory.

This version is purely for cenceptual demonstration purpose.
More than 70% of the files are removed from the original version,
and more than half of core functions are either removed or modified in the remaining files
so to make recovery of the original is absolutely impossible.
